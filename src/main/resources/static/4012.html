<span style="color: white;">Do your Spring Cloud Data Flow Apps require interaction with different Data Systems? <br> Data Services with PCF - Connectors, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Gemfire, are supported out-of-the-box & are a nice compliment to SCDF. However, sometimes additional sources or sinks are required. <br>  "great, you have a microservice / app / data flow, now it needs the actual data" <br>
Extend the source or sink at https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/dataflowprimer.&nbsp;&nbsp; When: 3/16/2017, Venue TBD</span><br style="color: white;">
