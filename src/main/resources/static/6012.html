<span style="color: white;">Micro-Services... at risk of becoming the new over-used term in the "cloud", there are real architectural patterns to follow for micro-services to be lightweight, scalable, well connected. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how Cloud Foundry becomes an enabler for your micro-services as it needs to cog-connect to many other services and sprawl to support your application structure. Spring Cloud Services also provides additional services that will make your micro-serviced-life easier, but providing to you what you need when you need it without having to create overly redundant tasks in holistic patterns that your organization can support. &nbsp;&nbsp; Venue TBD.</span><br style="color: white;">
